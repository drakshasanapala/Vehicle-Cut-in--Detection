Vehicle Cut-in Detection




Overview
Vehicle Cut-in Detection is a project that aims to detect and visualize vehicles cutting in front of a target vehicle using computer vision techniques. This can be useful for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving applications.

* OpenCV
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* MoviePy
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/bobthesiddharth/Vehicle-Cut-in-Detection.git
cd Vehicle-Cut-in-Detection
Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Running the Detection
To run the vehicle cut-in detection on a sample video, use the following command:
bash
Copy code
python detect_cutin.py --input path/to/input/video.mp4 --output path/to/output/video.mp4
Arguments
* --input: Path to the input video file.
* --output: Path to save the output video with detected cut-ins.
Example
bash
Copy code
python detect_cutin.py --input sample_videos/highway.mp4 --output output_videos/highway_output.mp4
Dataset
For training and testing, you can use open datasets like KITTI or BDD100K. Make sure to format the dataset properly and update the paths in the configuration files.
